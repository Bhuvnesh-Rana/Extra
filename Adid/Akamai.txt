distributed worldwide. What is a CDN?
A CDN is essentially a group of servers that are strategically placed across the globe with the purpose of accelerating the delivery
of web content. A CDN-Manages servers that are geographically distributed over different locations.

    Attempts to direct each user to a server that is part of the CDN so as to deliver content quickly.


To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of original content in multiple
 geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence/ PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers known as edge servers that are 
responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity. CDN caches content in many places at once, ensuring quick delivery of 
content.
